## Introduction

Welcome to the "NBA MVPs Prediction with Machine Learning" project! This project is divided into three main parts, each focusing on a specific aspect of the machine learning process for predicting NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) award winners.

## Project Overview

- Part 1: Data Collection
- Part 2: Data Cleaning and Preparation
- Part 3: Machine Learning for MVP Prediction

## Part 1: Data Collection

In this initial phase, we gather the necessary data for our MVP prediction. We utilize web scraping techniques to extract data from relevant sources, ensuring we have the most up-to-date and comprehensive dataset to work with.

## Part 2: Data Cleaning and Preparation

Data quality is essential for the success of any machine learning project. In this phase, we focus on cleaning and preparing the collected data. We handle missing values, remove outliers, and structure the dataset to make it suitable for machine learning. Effective data preprocessing is crucial for accurate predictions.

## Part 3: Machine Learning for MVP Prediction

The heart of the project lies in Part 3. Here, we dive into the world of machine learning. We employ various models and techniques to build a predictive model for NBA MVP winners. We'll explore feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation to create a robust and accurate prediction system.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Review the documentation in each part's respective directory.
3. Execute the provided code and experiment with different machine learning models.
